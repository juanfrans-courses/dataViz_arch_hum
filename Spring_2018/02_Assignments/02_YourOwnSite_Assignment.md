### Assignment 2 - Your Own Site (Individual)
Now that you have a pretty well developed sketch for your class site, go ahead and code it. Test it thoroughly on your local server and once it's done, upload it to your `gh-pages` branch on your Github repository. Once you upload it, make sure it runs well on the web: make sure the links (back and forth) work and the fonts are displayed as you designed them. Also make sure that the underlying structure of folders and files is clear and clean.

#### Deliverables
* Submit via Courseworks the **link to your class website**. Make sure this link works well and is not just a link to your Github repository.
* The website should have the following elements:
  * Landing page:
    * Title
    * Your name
    * A short bio (~ 100 words)
    * Links to the individual and group assignments
  * Assignment page:
    * This should be a template page, just so you think about how you will display your assignments and the navigation links to take you back to the other pages.

#### Due date
Your link should be submitted via Courseworks before the end of **Thursday, February 1**.
