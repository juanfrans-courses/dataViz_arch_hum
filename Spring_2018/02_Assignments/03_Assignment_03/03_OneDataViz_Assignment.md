### Assignment 3 - One Data Visualization (Individual)
For this assignment you will need to create a **single** data visualization piece. This means a single **static** image. And through it, explore one, or multiple aspects of a single dataset. You will need to explore the data and chose something to visualize. This can be a single variable or multiple, in combination or in relation. Think very carefully about what you want to visualize and how. Start by figuring out what question you are trying to answer. And then think about what the best way to answer that question is. Think about your data, about the relationship or the trends that you want to show, and think about the best way to display these.

#### Dataset
The data you will visualize is the PLUTO dataset for Manhattan, which contains data on every single lot in the borough. [Here](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/open-data/pluto_datadictionary.pdf?r=16v2) you will find the data dictionary with a description of every variable. This is an extremely rich and complex dataset so make sure you explore it carefully and read the documentation.

You can find the data files [here](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/dataViz_arch_hum/tree/master/Spring_2018/02_Assignments/03_Assignment_03). I've broken them down by neighborhood and the codes for the neighborhoods (in the name of the file) are [here](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/dataViz_arch_hum/blob/master/Spring_2018/02_Assignments/03_Assignment_03/NeighborhoodCodes.csv). You can choose to visualize one or multiple neighborhoods, or the whole borough. The files are `.txt` files and are `tab` delimited. You should be able to open them with Excel, Google Sheets or even Atom or Sublime (although I don't recommend these two for this task).

Feel free to transform the data, summarize it, filter it or extract meaningful statistics. You don't need to visualize the whole dataset or every single record (you can if you want, but you don't need to), but you do need to think about what story you are trying to tell.

#### References
Make sure you check out these chart galleries before you choose your method of visualization. Explore them and think about what type of chart best fits what you are trying to display.

#### Method
Choose any method you like. Hand sketch, Excel graph, Illustrator, d3.js, whatever you like. However, your visualization needs to be professional and fully finished. Again, you should be able to justify every design decision and every pixel on the page.

#### Write-up
Below your visualization, write at least 2 paragraphs describing your intentions, what you want to show, and your design decisions. What is interesting about what you are showing? What exactly are you showing? And why these design decisions are the best to show this?

#### Deliverables
* Upload your data visualization piece and your write-up to **your website** and submit a link to it via Courseworks.
* Your page should have:
  * Title
  * Visualization
  * Write-up
  * Link, back and forth, from your homepage.

#### Due date
Your link should be submitted via Courseworks before the end of **Thursday, February 8**.
