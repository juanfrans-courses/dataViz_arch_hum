### Assignment 4 - Coding Exercises - Colors and Distance
The assignment for this week is to use p5.js to recreate the following two sketches.

### Colors

#### Hint
* To create the squares your best bet might be to use a loop within a loop.
* For the color, you might want to change the "color mode" to HSB instead of the default RGB.
* Feel free to check the [reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/) on the p5.js site for more help.

### Bubbles

#### Hint
* The circles should be created more or less the same way you created the squares in the previous sketch.
* You should calculate the distance between the position of the mouse and the center of each circle, and use that distance to determine the radius (or diameter) of the circle. For this, take a look at the `dist()` function in p5.js.
* Also, it is a good idea to set a minimum and a maximum radius (or diameter) for the circles.
* Finally, the color also depends on the distance from the position of the mouse and the center of the circles.

#### Deliverables
* Submit the URL to your sketches to Courseworks. The sketches should be located in your website, with clear links to and from your homepage.

#### Due Date
* Submit your URL before the end of **Thursday, February 15**.
