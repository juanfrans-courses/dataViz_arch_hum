### Assignment 1 - Hello World! and Website Sketch (Individual)
Obviously, the first thing you will do for this class is to be able to show a "Hello World!" greeting in your screen. This means that you will have to write a small `.html` file and run a local server on your own machine to display this file in your browser. Note that this should not be done by simple opening the file via Chrome (or other browsers), but by *running a local server* and the url displayed on your browser should be something like `localhost:8000/index.html`.

In addition, you should create a detailed sketch of your future website for this class. This can be done by hand or by computer (Illustrator, etc), but you have to print it and bring it to class (make two copies, one for you and another to hand in). Think carefully about how you will arrange all the different elements of your website and how the different pages will connect. In theory you should be able to *justify every single pixel* in your design. Of course you will be able to redesign and improve your site as the course progresses but this doesn't mean this sketch should be well thought out and thoroughly designed.

#### Deliverables
1. An `.html` file with a "Hello World!" statement ready to be displayed via a local server.
2. A sketch of your own website for this class. This website should have the following elements:
  * Landing page:
    * Title
    * Your name
    * A short bio (~ 100 words)
    * Links to the individual and group assignments
  * Assignment page:
    * This should be a template page, just so you think about how you will display your assignments and the navigation links to take you back to the other pages.

#### Notes on website design
* Keep it simple. It's better to have a simple site that works well and doesn't distract than a flashy one that's hard to navigate and gets in the way of your work.
* This is not a graphic design or UX design class. Don't overthink it. That being said, do think about it thoroughly.
* Think about hierarchies (what's more important) and adjust fonts sizes and weights accordingly.
* Think about what type(s) of font(s) you will use. The rule of thumb is no more than 2 different font types. One is totally fine.
* Think about font weights: bold, normal, thin, italics and make use of those differences. However, just because you can use them doesn't mean you have to. If you do use them, there has to be a purpose.
* Think about color, background and font color. Feel free to experiment, but ultimately choose something that works and doesn't get in the way of what you really want to show.
* Finally, take a look at many websites and really deconstruct how they are designed. What are the different font sizes, are items centered, where are the images, how are sections divided and how does the navigation happen. Choose a couple that you really like and start by replicating them, and then, modify them to make them suit your purposes.
* A final note on designing for the web: these days it has become crucial to design for mobile devices as well as for desktop and laptop computers. In fact, many designers actually design for mobile first, and then adapt their designs to work for other devices. However, we will not do this in our class. Because of time constraints we are only able to devote time to designing for laptops and desktops. In your professional world, however, make sure that your designs are 100% compatible with mobile devices.

#### Due date
You should bring your website sketch and be ready to display the "Hello World!" greeting on the **Friday, January 26** class.
