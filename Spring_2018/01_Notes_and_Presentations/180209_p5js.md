# Notes Week 3 (February 9, 2018) - Introduction to p5.js
* Blog
* Assignment - Data Visualization
* [Git Cheat Sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) is a great resource.

## Discussion - Readings
* *Michael Friendly - A Brief History of Data Visualization*:
  * What are the things or developments that help or hinder data viz
  * Examples
  * What kind of data
  * Medium
  * *The earliest seeds of visualization arose in geometric diagrams, in tables of the positions of stars and other celestial bodies, and in the making of maps to aid in navigation and exploration.*
  * [Planetary movements - 10th century](https://researchmethodsgdansk.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/earliest-graphic.jpg)
  * *Among the most important problems of the 17th century were those concerned with physical measurement— of time, distance, and space— for astronomy, surveying, map making, navigation and territorial expansion.*
  * *rise of analytic geometry and coordinate systems, theories of errors of measurement and estimation, the birth of probability theory (Pascal and Fermat), and the beginnings of demographic statistics (John Graunt) and “political arithmetic” (William Petty)— the study of population, land, taxes, value of goods, etc. for the purpose of understanding the wealth of the state.*
  * *[Small multiples of change in sunspots](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K8AiQaV4Hy4/WKhX26SgH9I/AAAAAAAAYMI/ScJ-wVSaFpwT-b_uVeIs0WVwYPd05kr1ACLcB/s1600/Christopher%2BScheiner%2527s%2B1626%2Brepresentation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bchanges%2Bin%2Bsunspots%2Bover%2Btime%2B%25281630%252C%2Brecordings%2Bfrom%2B1611%2529.png)*
  * *[Distance from Toledo to Rome](https://i1.wp.com/ai4sight.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RomeToToledo.jpg)*
  * *Abstract graphs, and graphs of functions became more widespread, along with the early beginnings of statistical theory (measurement error) and systematic collection of empirical data. (18th century)*
  * *William Playfair is widely considered the inventor of most of the graphical forms we use today: line graph, bar chart, pie chart and circle graph*
  * [Price of Wheat](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wam/images/e/ee/William-playfair-wheat-original.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141014165055)
  * *In statistical graphics, all of the modern forms of data display were invented: bar and pie charts, histograms, line graphs and time-series plots, contour plots, scatterplots, and so forth.*
  * *More significantly, in 1825, the Ministry of Justice in France instituted the first centralized national system of crime reporting, collected quarterly from all departments and recording the details of every charge laid before the French courts.*
  * *Charles Joseph Minard* [Tableau Figuratif](http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/images/enpc/img09d.jpg)*
  * *Statistical theory, initiated by Gauss and Laplace, and extended to the social realm by Guerry and Quetelet, provided the means to make sense of large bodies of data.*
  * *Galton’s role in the development of the ideas of correlation and regression are well-known. Less well-known is the role that visualization and graphing played in his contributions and discoveries.*

  * *Moreover, perhaps for the first time, graphical methods proved crucial in a number of new insights, discoveries, and theories in astronomy, physics, biology, and other sciences.*
  * *John Tukey & Jacques Bertin*
  * *By the end of this period significant intersections and collaborations would begin: (a) com- puter science research (software tools, C language, UNIX, etc.) at Bell Laboratories (Becker, 1994) and elsewhere would combine forces with (b) developments in data analysis (EDA, psy- chometrics, etc.) and (c) display and input technology (pen plotters, graphic terminals, digitizer tablets, the mouse, etc.). These developments would provide new paradigms, languages and software packages for expressing statistical ideas and implementing data graphics. In turn, they would lead to an explosive growth in new visualization methods and techniques.*
    * *the development of highly interactive statistical computing systems. Initially, this meant largely command-driven, directly programmable systems (APL, S), as opposed to com- piled, batch processing;*
    * *newparadigmsofdirectmanipulationforvisualdataanalysis(linking,brushing(BeckerandCleveland, 1987), selection, focusing, etc.);*
    * *new methods for visualizing high-dimensional data (the grand tour (Asimov, 1985), scat- terplot matrix (Tukey and Tukey, 1981), parallel coordinates plot (Inselberg, 1985, Wegman, 1990), spreadplots (Young, 1994a), etc.);*
    * *the invention (or re-invention) of graphical techniques for discrete and categorical data;*
    * *the application of visualization methods to an ever-expanding array of substantive problems and data structures*
    * *substantially increased attention to the cognitive and perceptual aspects of data display.*

## Introduction to p5.js
* What is it? Library of functions

### Setup
* Download
* Where to put it
* Link it in the `html`:
```html

    <title>Intro to p5.js</title>
    <!-- Stylesheet link -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/site-specific.css">
    <!-- Link to the p5.js library -->
    <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="../libraries/p5.js"></script>
    <!-- Link to p5 sketch file -->

    <div class="title">
      <h1>INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT - P5.JS</h1>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Basic structure
* First example:
```js
// Setup function
function setup(){
  createCanvas(800, 800);
  console.log('Setup complete...')
}

// Draw function
function draw(){
  fill(0);
  ellipse(50, 50, 400, 400);
}
```

* Second example:
```js
// Setup function
function setup(){
  createCanvas(800, 800);
  console.log('Setup complete...')
}

// Draw function
function draw(){
  if (mouseIsPressed){
    fill(0);
  }
  else {
    fill(255);
  }
  ellipse(50, 50, width/2, height/2);
}
```

* Third example:
```js
// Setup function
function setup(){
  createCanvas(800, 800);
  console.log('Setup complete...')
}

// Draw function
function draw(){
  if (mouseIsPressed){
    fill(0);
  }
  else {
    fill(255);
  }
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, width/2, height/2);
}
```

* Fourth example:
```js
// Setup function
function setup(){
  createCanvas(800, 800);
  console.log('Setup complete...')
}

// Draw function
function draw(){
  if (mouseIsPressed){
    fill(0);
  }
  else {
    fill(255);
  }
  ellipse(50, 50, mouseX, mouseY);
}
```

* Fifth example:
```js
// Setup function
function setup(){
  createCanvas(800, 800);
  console.log('Setup complete...')
}

// Draw function
function draw(){
  if (mouseIsPressed){
    fill(0);
  }
  else {
    fill(255);
  }
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ellipse(mouseX + i * 60, mouseY, 50, 50);
  }
}
```

* Sixth example:
```js
// Setup function
function setup(){
  createCanvas(800, 800);
  console.log('Setup complete...')
}

// Draw function
function draw(){
  fill(0);
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
      rect(50 + i * 60, 50 + i * 60, 50, 50);
    }
  }
}
```

* Other useful functions:
  * `colorMode(RGB, 255)` or `colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100, 1)` or `colorMode(HSL)`
  * `background()`
  * `noFill()`
  * `stroke()` or `noStroke()` or `strokeWeight()`
  * `point()`, `line()`, `ellipse()`, `rect()`
  * `preload()`
  * `print()`
