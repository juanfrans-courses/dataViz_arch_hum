# Data Visualization for Architecture, Urbanism and the Humanities
* Columbia University | GSAPP and A&S | ARCHA4892 | Spring 2018
* Fridays 9am - 11am | Ware Lounge (600 Avery)
* Professor: Juan Francisco Saldarriaga (jfs2118)
* Teaching Assistant: Buck Wanner (brw2103)
* Office hours:
  * Juan: TBD (previous email required)
  * Buck: TBD (previous email required)

## Course Overview
This course provides an introduction to data visualization theory and methods for students entirely new to the fields of computation and information design. Through a series of in-class exercises and take-home assignments, students will learn how to critically engage and produce interactive data visualization pieces that can serve as exploratory and analytical tools. The course is part of a larger initiative, hosted by the [Center for Spatial Research](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/) to teach courses in the critical use of digital tools across fields in architecture, urbanism, and the humanities.

The course will be centered around a semester long data visualization group project, through which the students will learn the basics of data visualization, data analysis, data collection, programming and version control. However, even though the course will teach specific visualization tools, the main conceptual thread will be centered around how to work with data, both in the humanities and in architecture and urbanism. Students will define their final projects around their own interests, and will bring their own datasets into their final projects.

## General Topics
* Data visualization history and concepts
* Working with data: collection and analysis
* Basic programming skills and web languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
* Interactivity and online data visualization
* Collaborative work and version control (GitHub)
* Working with text data
* APIs and Web-scraping
* Generative art

## Evaluation and Grading
* 10% Class participation and discussion
* 20% Individual assignments and homework
* 15% Midterm presentation
* 20% Data visualization critique
* 35% Final project and final presentation

## Resources and Materials
Course files, tutorials and presentations will be located on Courseworks, on the [Center for Spatial Research](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/) website and on this repository.

The readings for the class will be duly uploaded to this repository. Students will be required to submit their assignments by uploading them to Courseworks. Finally, the class will also rely heavily on submissions to the blog. Students will be required to upload some of their own work as well as inspirational material, encouraging and developing a critical stance and visual skills.
