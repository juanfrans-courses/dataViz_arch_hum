#### Hint
* To create the squares your best bet might be to use a loop within a loop.
* For the color, you might want to change the "color mode" to HSB instead of the default RGB.
* Feel free to check the [reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/) on the p5.js site for more help.

#### Deliverables
* Submit the URL to your sketch AND the URL to the Github repository where you have this sketch.

### Due Date
* Submit your exercise before the end of **Thursday, March 23**.
