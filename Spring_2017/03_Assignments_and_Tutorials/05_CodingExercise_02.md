### Coding Exercise 2 - Distance
Try to recreate the following site through a p5.js sketch (or other Javascript libraries).

![Distance to Circle](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/dataViz_arch_hum/blob/master/Spring_2017/03_Assignments_and_Tutorials/img/02_Exercise.gif)

#### Hint
* The circles should be created more or less the same way you created the squares in the previous exercise.
* You should calculate the distance between the position of the mouse and the center of each circle, and use that distance to determine the radius (or diameter) of the circle. For this, take a look at the `dist()` function in p5.js.
* Also, it is a good idea to set a minimum and a maximum radius (or diameter) for the circles.
* Finally, the color also depends on the distance from the position of the mouse and the center of the circles.

#### Deliverables
* Submit the URL to your sketch AND the URL to the Github repository where you have this sketch.

### Due Date
* Submit your exercise before the end of **Thursday, March 23**.
