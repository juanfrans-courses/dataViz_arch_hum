### Assignment 3 - Visualization of one dataset (individual)
There are always multiple ways of visualizing any dataset. It all depends on what you find interesting, what is relevant and how you decide to visualize it. In this exercise, everybody will be visualizing the same dataset. However, exactly what you visualize or how you do it is entirely up to you. You can choose any aspect of the dataset to visualize, as well as any means of visualization.

You don't need to visualize the whole dataset or every aspect of it. In fact, it is highly recommended you first study the data and then, once you know what you will visualize, you filter the dataset so you are only working with what you want to show. Also, you can choose any method of visualization you like. You can create the visualization online (interactive or static), printed, through a physical model or even through dance. It only needs to be visual and to do a good job at presenting whatever you chose to visualize.

Nevertheless, your visualization and whatever you choose to visualize from the dataset, has to be compelling, relevant and interesting. Don't just choose a random aspect of the data to visualize. *You are responsible for finding a vital angle in the data and for presenting it in a compelling manner.*

As always, use the readings, your previous assignments and all the posts in the blog to find inspiration and help. And think very carefully about all the aspects of your visualization: fonts, colors, layouts, types of charts or graphs, legends, text, etc.

#### Dataset
The dataset you will be visualizing belongs comes from the Registro Único de Víctimas in Colombia, and it contains all the registered victims of the Colombian conflict. This data was collected by the Colombian government through voluntary declarations by the victims of the conflict. As any dataset, it has its own biases and errors, but it does provide an extremely comprehensive view of the conflict. Also, note that this dataset is still being updated, so the version you are using here is not the most up to date.

The following are it fields and their variables:
* TIPO DE VICTIMA (wether or not a victim falls within a specific law or is just a victim of the conflict):
  * Víctimas del conflicto armado (regular victims of the conflict)
  * Víctimas reconocidas Sentencia C280 y Auto 119 de 2013 (victims that fall within this law)
* ANIO OCURRENCIA (year in which the crime occurred)
* DANE OCURRENCIA (code of the municipality in which the crime occurred)
* DEPARTAMENTO (department in which the crime occurred)
* MUNICIPIO (municipality in which the crime occurred)

#### Deliverables
Whatever it is that you are producing, you should submit it on Courseworks. You can submit links to sites, PDFs of static images, videos, images of physical models, etc.

### Due Date
