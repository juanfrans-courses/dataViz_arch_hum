### Notes on Final Review

#### World of a Syrian Refugee
* Cartogram (UNHRC data)
* Cartogram as a storytelling tool + other layers of information.
* GDELT dataset: very good graph but it would be great if it was interactive, and you could sort and normalize by different variables.
* The bubble chart is ok, but it could have been more interesting.
* Details are missing, is this data normalized?
* Question the data more, derive more information (milestones) from the same dataset.
* Good framing but push further the ways you are comparing the datasets.

#### Who gains and looses from AirBnB?
* [Project site](http://www.srimmele.com/dataviz_final_project/pages/scatter.html)
* Scatter plot maps(?) (interesting...)
* Again, sorting or comparing to different variables would have enriched the visualization much more.
* Better labeling and explanation
* More annotations
* Look at the extreme cases and highlight some of them.
