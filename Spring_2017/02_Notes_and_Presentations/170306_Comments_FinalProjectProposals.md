## Comments on Final Project Proposals

### Group 1 (William Bodell, Ubaldo Escalante, Steven Getz, Matthew Lohry, Isabel Xiao)
#### Title?
* What exactly is your thesis or hypothesis? It seems like you are bringing together many different datasets (migration, economy, banking and real estate) and I don't see a clear connection. I'm sure there are many connections, but if you are bringing them all together there needs to be a **clear** one.
* In this sense, this might be a very interesting project: if you have a thesis or a hypothesis about all this and you can actually make a point or demonstrate it through a data visualization piece. It will be an **argumentative** one.
* However, you have to be careful not to do just an exploratory piece. Since your datasets are not naturally or easily connected, if you do an exploratory piece you might just loose yourselves in the exploration and miss the point.
* What exactly is the conflict here? What are the different forces at play and the different actors?
* What if there are no clear connections between global economic statistics and urban expansion? Economic data is extremely difficult to parse and highly variable, make sure there's a connection. If there isn't, then that's also something but you have to make a point, you have to have a narrative, otherwise you will just get lost in the exploration.
* Your current hypothesis is too broad and general (that "there are some interesting social, spatial, political and economic dynamics at work"), so make sure you have something much more precise and specific.
* You could just make it about economic growth (real estate or banking or other) in cities with high migration. This is just a suggestion but it's an example of something that is precise enough and clear enough that it's easily explored and explained through a data visualization piece. It could be a comparison between cities with high migration and cities with low migration in economic terms. Or a comparison between different cities with high migration.

### Group 2 (Ge Zhao, Majed Abdulsamad, Maria Khan, Jianghanhan Li)
#### A Data Visualization of Forced Migration
* This is a very ambitious project, maybe too ambitious. Each one of your points could be a project in itself and a big one. I would strongly encourage you to choose one, maybe the first one or the second one (mainstream media coverage or social media rhetoric).
* If you have never tried to get data from APIs or through web-scrapping you should try it as soon as possible. There's a lot of work involved and there's a lot of data cleaning that needs to happen. I'm not trying to discourage you from doing this, just advising you to start as soon as you can.
* Have you ever done topic modeling or sentiment analysis? If you have, you probably know that neither is an exact science and that both require a lot of trial and error. If you haven't, you should read about them as soon as you can to know what you are getting into.
* Also, know that getting historical data is extremely difficult and expensive, so if you are going with the social media data route, you should start collecting data right now.
* Take a look at this [project](http://www.emoto2012.org/downloads/emoto_published.pdf) to get an idea of something similar which also involves Twitter data and sentiment analysis.

### Group 3 (Richard Fudge, Madeleine, McGrory, Kun Qiam, Simon Rimmele)
#### Title?
* Interesting project.
* What is the reason for comparing the rent price with Airbnb? I don't think people who would try to get affordable housing units are looking at Airbnb as an alternative. It might be better to compare it with other rental prices and if you want to do some web-scrapping you can try getting the data from StreetEasy (I can show you how to scrape the data).
* Be careful with using the term 'gentrification'. If you are going to use it, and I'm not discouraging you, you should define it well. What exactly does it mean? What are the measures of a gentrifying neighborhood?
* I think you know this but just to be clear, in this kind of project you need to set really clear thresholds, what is affordable? How much of the income should go to housing? etc, etc.

### Group 5 (Timur Abbiasov, Ying Huang, Carmelo Ignaccolo, Jesfae John)
#### What is the cost of our city's heritage?
* Very interesting project.
* However, I don't know if you will be able to get the data you are looking for. We already talked about this a bit and I think that some kind of data is possible (number of buildings, which buildings, composition of the commission, number of applications, etc), but getting funding data might be too hard. That being said, I think you still have a strong project with the data mentioned above.
* We also talked about not making the map the central part of your project. Think about other ways of displaying this data: could you do it through pictures of the buildings? This might actually generate a more interesting and visually striking project.
* Can you analyze the data based on who was the mayor of NY at the moment? Or the head of the commission? You can make it about the people who are running the commissions or are making the decisions. How does each administration affect preservation?
* Also, think about what is the "conflict" here? What are the pressures for each side and how do you visualize the different forces involved in this conflict.

### Group 6 (Matthias Neill, Shahneez Haseeb, Zhengyin Lu, Cesar Eduardo Montiel Olea)
#### Make America Great Again
* I like the "Make America Great Again" idea much better, not only because you don't have the Uber data and you don't know when you will get it, if you do get it, but also because I think it's a more interesting and visually compelling project.
* Also, you can find data on the most pro-Trump cities by looking at election results.
* I like the comparison format, I think it's an interesting and self contained project so go for this one.
* Try also to illustrate things with images, not just data.
* And you can also move a two different scales, the city scale and the personal one, bringing in some personal stories to make your data more relatable.

### Group TBD (Tola Oniyangi, Rachael Dottle, Eric Wong, Clara Dykstra, Andreea Seusan)
#### Title?
* Very interesting project.
* I like the idea of comparing host descriptions to user reviews and visualizing narratives about neighborhood identities. Each one of those could be its own project but I would encourage you to pursue both.
* Is this only for New York? If you have the scripts ready and the analysis, you might want to try if for a couple of more cities, like San Francisco, Chicago, Boston or DC. Start with NY and see how it goes, but it might easy to expand.
* If possible, I would avoid other data sources and stick with Airbnb.
* Jus make sure you test your scripts and your data gathering techniques in advance, there might be some restrictions to using the API or scrapping the site or a lot of data processing to do.
