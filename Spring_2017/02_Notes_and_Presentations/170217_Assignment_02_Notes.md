## Assignment 2 (Presentation of a Data Visualization Project) - Notes

### Group 1 (William Bodell, Ubaldo Escalante, Steven Getz, Matthew Lohry, Isabel Xiao)- [How the Recession Reshaped the Economy, in 255 Charts & A 3-D View of a Chart That Predicts The Economic Future: The Yield Curve (by The New York Times)](https://webthethird.github.io/DataVisTeam1/assignments/assignment_02.html)
* [Github Repository](https://github.com/webthethird/DataVisTeam1/tree/gh-pages)
* Think about demoing the actual project, this might be the best way to explain it.
* Although interesting and dynamic, the style of your site (scrolling text on top of images) might not be the best way to present the projects.
* That being said, the side by side comparison does work and it's helpful and clear.
* Strong text descriptions.
* Overall analysis is strong but the visual explanation is not as clear as it could be.
* The description of the charts (specially the 'yield curve') could have been a little more detailed.
* You should note that the two pieces are heavily scripted, they really walk you through the data and there's a "narration". They don't just simple let you play with the data and explore it freely. This means that there's is a clear intent here, maybe a point of view? If so, what is this point of view? Or is this just a result of the fact that this is the New York Times and they really care about the aesthetics of their graphics and want to control the narrative?
* You could say that the two charts are trying to go in opposite directions: one is trying to "explode" the economy and the other one is trying to "unify" it. Is it fair to compare them then?
* As brought up in class, 2D vs 3D is maybe not the most helpful judgement criteria to end with, there were other factors you looked at that might have been more helpful to discuss in the conclusion.

### Group 2 (Ge Zhao, Majed Abdulsamad, Maria Khan, Jianghanhan Li)- [Out of Sight, Out of Mind (by Pitch Interactive)](https://majedabdulsamad.github.io/Group2/index.html)
* [Github Repository](https://github.com/majedabdulsamad/group2/tree/gh-pages)
* Good idea to link all the data sources right at the beginning. Do you know if there was a process of cleaning up the data?
* Good work breaking down all the 'view modes' of the visualization. It would be beneficial to include a summary of that in the website itself.
* Good analysis of some of the visual choices, for example, colors. However, some elements are not that important (at least not in this visualization), like typeface, so there's no need to include it.
* The approach your group took could be seen as "critique by redesign": this is an interesting choice, and allowed you to make some strong points. You also pointed out the drawbacks of this approach – it might create a less neutral presentation. Also, there's only so much a visualization can do before it becomes too broad and weak.
* Good work in that you also critiqued their data.
* Think more, or ask yourselves more about the point of view or intent of the visualization. Question the motives more. Which doesn't mean that having a point of view is wrong, but we need to understand it and talk about it.
* Think about who the target audience is (good point about the languages this visualization can be viewed in). Is there a client?
* Animation really guides the visualization and the timing is very important. This is a clear mark that there is a narrative and therefore an argument that is being made.
* Good analysis of the data (civilians vs. children vs. others)
* Good point bringing up comparison charts.

### Group 3 (Richard Fudge, Madeleine, McGrory, Kun Qiam, Simon Rimmele) - [U.S. Gun Deaths by Periscope](https://kq2137.github.io/Presentation-Group-3/index.html)
* [Github Repository](https://github.com/kq2137/Presentation-Group-3/tree/gh-pages)
* While the visualization itself is indeed not the most clear, the presentation on the website could have done more explanation of the elements to reveal what was going on.
* The animation is the central piece of the visualization and as such, there should be a more in depth discussion about how it works, what the idea behind it is and it's power.
* You do talk about the piece as an emotionally evocative visualization (arcs and colors) but you could have elaborated much more on this.
* Consider breaking down the presentation (website) into more sections. Rather than just say something doesn't work, break out each element of analysis and give more detail around why it worked or didn't; also the implications on how it might have achieved what it set out to do.
* What was the effect of each visual choice? Before critiquing would be helpful to give fuller explanation of what the choices were achieving.
* What were the uses and limitations of the data choices? The goals behind the 2010 and 2013 visualizations were perhaps different: 2013 was originally being made in real time (over the course of the year), hence using Twitter data. How does this impact how we should read the goals of the project?
* Was the visualization misleading? If so, does this really matter? Consider the intent and the audience, is there a client? Who's the target audience?
* Good discussion, although there should have been more analysis on the poetics of the piece and how it relates to the supposedly objectivity of the data.

### Group 5 (Timur Abbiasov, Ying Huang, Carmelo Ignaccolo, Jesfae John) - [The Rhythm of Food by Google News Lab and Truth & Beauty](https://tabbiasov.github.io/Assignment2-RhythmOfFood/)
* [Github Repository](https://github.com/tabbiasov/Assignment2-RhythmOfFood/tree/gh-pages)
* Initial animation on user experience is aesthetically exciting, but might consider giving more context at the beginning, or we don't know what we're looking at. Consider putting information (presented on intro page) next to the visualization itself.
* Analysis of elements on website clear and well done, but more were discussed in the presentation, and would be better to include those elements on website critique as well.
* The visualization uses a graph that's difficult to understand. Good try at explaining this.
* Good analysis on the structure of the website (Martini glass).
* What is the geographic bias? Is there one? This is an important fact and it should be mentioned up front.
* Conclusion could have been more thorough. Consider less a "good/bad" conclusion, and more an analysis of what the effects, uses, and limits of the visualization could be.

### Group 6 (Matthias Neill, Shahneez Haseeb, Zhengyin Lu, Cesar Eduardo Montiel Olea) - [What's Really Warming The World? by Bloomberg](https://matthiaskn.github.io/Data_Vis_Assignment_2/index.html)
* [Github Repository](https://github.com/MatthiasKN/Data_Vis_Assignment_2/tree/gh-pages)
* Presentation of visualization was clear, but could use commentary along with the screenshots of initial visualization (also in the project presentation section).
* Other groups did this as well, but while the critiques of the weaknesses of the visualization included visual elements, the analysis of the strengths relied on text. Consider how you can use visual arguments to illuminate strengths, positives, or even just describing the visualization.
* You noted, regarding Data Processing, that "The authors of this visualization do not provide information on how they processed the data." Why is this significant? You don't actually note why it would matter, though your observation suggests it does. Consider including that kind of perspective as well.
* Leading questions, it is clearly not a neutral project, but does this work? Can data convince?
* Sequence? Is there a reason for this sequence?
* Good analysis of the scroll progression.
* Maybe consider a "conclusions" section? Was unclear what your final stance of the visualization was, though the elements were noted at different points.

### Group TBD (Tola Oniyangi, Rachael Dottle, Eric Wong, Clara Dykstra, Andreea Seusan)- [Data Sketches by Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu](https://rdottle.github.io/grouptbd-assignment2/)
* [Github Repository](https://github.com/rdottle/grouptbd-assignment2/tree/gh-pages)
* Good explanation of the sources and the different approaches by the two authors
* Gave good critiques of strengths and weakness of each visualization. Though, even if the flowers visualization is lacking in communicating information, could have considered what it did on an affective or emotional level. What does looking at summer movie analyses as flowers communicate about the project? How might this be useful, even if it doesn't help in comparing films so easily?
* Could have spend a little more time really detailing how the flower project worked, how is each flower constructed? What do the colors mean? This way you could really get into the creative process and illustrate how to create a fully custom data visualization piece.
* You could have talked more about how these projects are more narrative and exploratory than the others, and how this is also a vital part of data visualization.

### General Comments for All Groups
Based on your presentations, think about the following things for your final project:
* What does it take to build a good database to use in your data visualization project? What is the best way to **collect, clean and organize** your data.
* Think about how you want your visualization to work: do you want to build something that has a strong narrative component or something that let's the user explore the data more freely? Do you have a strong point of view that you want to convey or do you want to present your work as more neutral?
* And based on this, think about a narrative or a story for your visualization. Do you **need** a strong narrative or not?
* And based on this too, think about interactivity. How interactive should your visualization be? It should be interactive, but to what degree, total freedom or a very scripted kind of interactivity?
* What is going to be the central piece of your visualization project? An animation? A huge interactive chart? Multiple small charts? What type of website are you building? A 'martini glass' or a 'coke bottle', or something else?
* And based on these choices, think about what technical skills you need to really develop? Is it animations or is it interactivity? Or both?
* Think about design choices, summary, aggregation, disaggregation, explosion, etc.
* And finally, think about the inherent tension in data visualization, data vs. point of view, and how you are going to deal with that.
