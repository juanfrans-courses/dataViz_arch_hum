## Notes 03/31/2017 - Text Analysis

#### What can we count in text?
* Frequency
* Total number of words
* Number of words per sentences
* Syllables
* Types of words
* Roots of words ("stemming")
* Order of the type of words (ie. you can identify the type of novel (ie. Gothic novels) by the order of types of words or density of types of words).

#### Camps
* *Distant reading* (Franco Moretti): trying to classify genres based on what we can calculate and count
* *Cultural metrics*: we can tell things about our culture based on text analysis.
